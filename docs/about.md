# ABOUT ME

Hey wonderful human! My name is **Sachin Tiwari** and I'm thrilled to have you here on my page! I'm a **Software Enginner** with 3 years of experience in the field, and I'm passionate about _Low-code technologies, full-stack development_ along with _Data Science_.

I'm from a sweet ancient place called **Varanasi** _(Kashi or Banaras as you know it)_ in India. I completed by Bachelors from **NIT Jalandhar** in Punjab and have since been working in **Optum**.

When I'm not working, you can find me writing blogs (_you can find my articles [here](https://medium.com/@sachintiwari2)_), cooking something spicy, biking, binge watching series and leisure walking ( _not the one for exercises ;o_). I also enjoy spending time with my family, trying out new restaurants and cuisines, and exploring my neighbourhoods.

I love listening & telling stories, philosophical discussions or simply irritating my siblings.

Feel free to connect with me over [Insta chats](https://www.instagram.com/classicaldobby) or just [mail me](mailto:sachintiwari2058@gmail.com) and let's get to know each other!

Keep finding beautiful surprises!
